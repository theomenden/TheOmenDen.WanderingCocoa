## Wandering Cocoa
### Problem:
* On Bedrock Edition, wandering traders offer up Cocoa Beans as a trade. This isn't present on Java Edition.
### Solution:
* Installing this mod will add Cocoa Beans as possible trades via wandering traders for emeralds, and will add in the ability to trade Cocoa Beans as brown dye.
### Credits:
* Shedaniel for Architectury
